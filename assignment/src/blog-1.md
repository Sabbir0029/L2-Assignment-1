Titel : The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Definition of union : 

In TypeScript, a union type allows a variable to hold values of multiple specified types. Defined using the | symbol, it enables flexible type assignments, such as string | number, meaning a value can be either a string or a number.

Why use of union type:

In TypeScript, union types allow variables to hold multiple types, increasing flexibility and reducing errors. They enable more versatile function parameters, enhance code readability, and provide better type safety by narrowing types during conditional checks.

Definition of Intersection type :

In TypeScript, an Intersection Type combines multiple types into one, requiring all properties from each type. Defined using &, it ensures an object satisfies all included types, useful for merging interfaces or creating complex type requirements.

Why use of intersection type :

The intersection type in TypeScript combines multiple types into one. It allows an object to inherit properties from multiple types, enabling more flexible and precise type definitions. This ensures better type safety and code reusability, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion :

In TypeScript, the union type allows a variable to hold multiple types, denoted with a pipe (|), providing flexibility. The intersection type, using an ampersand (&), combines multiple types into one, ensuring that a variable satisfies all the combined types. Both enable powerful type composition.
